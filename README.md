## Motivation

This app has been developed to help 3rd grade German school students to remember the multiplication tables.

## Goals

- ask multiplication problems in range little multiplication tables (1x1 ... 10x10)
- ask division problems that apply to the multiplication tables

## Non-Goals

- higher level mathematical challenges
- no trivial tasks such as division by one or multiplication by one or zero.

## How to Run

Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
tar -xf 1x1Pass.tar
./1x1Pass
```
